# Pneumonia-Xray-images
Objective of this dataset determine whether a person suffers pneumonia or not?

 I want to share what I actually did there. So the objective of this challenge is to determine whether a person suffers pneumonia or not. If yes, then determine whether it’s caused by bacteria or viruses. Well, I think this project should be called classification instead of detection.
